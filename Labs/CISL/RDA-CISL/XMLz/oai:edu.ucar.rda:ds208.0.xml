   <title>Sadler's Tropical Wind Climatology, 1960-1973</title>
   <summary>
      <p>Long term monthly mean winds which Sadler derived from his
              collection of aircraft data (which we have in <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds365.0/">DS365.0.</a>)
              and average rawinsonde data.  The aircraft data were obtained
              from two sources: operational GTS reports collected in Honolulu
              and the FHWF; and aircraft logs from many routes which often
              were not reported over the GTS.  The aircraft winds were
              summarized for each month in 5-degree latitude-longitude squares.
              The average monthly rawinsonde data were then combined with
              these in manual analyses of streamlines and isotachs.  The 2.5-
              degree grids of wind speed and direction were manually read from
              these.
              </p>
      <p>Unless you have a special interest in this dataset, DSS recommends that you
              use one of our reanalysis datasets, such as <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds090.2/">ds090.2</a>.  That's because those are
              based on a more complete collection of observations, improved analysis methods,
              and are provided in a common modern format (GRIB).
