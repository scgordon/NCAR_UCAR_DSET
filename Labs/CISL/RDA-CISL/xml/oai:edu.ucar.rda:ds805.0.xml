   <title>Ozone Data for the World, 1951May-1975December</title>
   <summary>
      <p>The daily and monthly mean total ozone observations in this dataset were digitized
              from "Ozone Data for the World", published by the Meteorological
              Service of Canada in cooperation with the World Meteorological
              Organization (WMO).</p>
      <p>The published monthly mean total ozone
              values were sometimes found to be in error, in which case the
              errors were corrected in the digitized version.  Some stations
              revise and correct previously published values of ozone which
              were in error perhaps because of lack of instrument calibration
              or an error in data reduction techniques.</p>
