   <title>Climate Model Products from the United Kingdom's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HCCPR)</title>
   <summary>
      <p>This dataset contains climate model output products from the
              United Kingdom's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and
              Research (HCCPR).  The model output consists of monthly grids from five
              runs of HCCPR's HadCM2 model that were made in 1995.  These runs were a
              <i>control</i> (constant atmospheric forcing) run, two
              <i>greenhouse gas</i> runs which assumed a constant compounded
              percentage per year (either 0.5% or 1%) increase in
              CO<sub>2</sub>, and two <i>aerosol</i> runs which combined the
              CO<sub>2</sub> and sulfate aerosol concentrations.  The model
              has a spatial resolution of 3.75-degree by 2.5-degree
              (96 by 73).</p>
      <p>DSS has computed decadal mean grids for each decade-month
              from the monthly mean grids.  The decade means are computed for
              years 0 through 9 of each decade.  We also computed smoothed
              decadal means by computing 30-year running means of the decadal
              mean grids.  Because of the large variability in the decadal
              means of variables such as precipitation, we recommend using the
              30-year (smoothed decadal) means and applying them to the year
              at the middle of the 30-year period (i.e. - the 30-year mean for
              2070-2099 should be applied at year 2085).</p>
