   <title>NOAA (ERL) Highly Reflective Cloud (HRC) Analyses, monthly 1971-1985</title>
   <summary>
      <p>NOAA has computed monthly total and normalized monthly total
              grids from daily 1-degree grids of highly reflective clouds
              (HRC) for January 1971 to December 1985.  In addition to these
              grids, there are grids indicating the number of missing days in
              the monthly total grids, and long term means and standard
              deviations of normalized monthly total grids.</p>
      <p>These data are based on once daily visible pictures from
              orbiting satellites. The pictures were manually inspected for
              highly reflective clouds. If a 1-degree lat-lon square was
              dominated by such clouds that were likely to be associated with
              precipitation, a "yes" was recorded for the square.</p>
