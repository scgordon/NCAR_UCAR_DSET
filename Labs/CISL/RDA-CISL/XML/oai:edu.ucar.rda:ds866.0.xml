   <title>GISS Global Methane and Livestock Distribution, 1-Degree</title>
   <summary>
      <p>A global high resolution data base of animal population
              densities and associated methane (CH4) emissions has been
              developed at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
              (NASA/GISS). The animal population statistics were based
              primarily on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
              compilations and other sources. The animals were distributed
              using a 1-degree by 1-degree resolution data base of countries and
              land-use (Matthews, 1983). The animals included are cattle and
              dairy cows, water buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, pigs, horses,
              and caribou. Estimates of methane production from each animal
              type were applied to the animal populations to yield a global
              distribution of methane emissions by animals. About 55% of the
              global annual emissions was concentrated between 25 N and 55 N.
              Estimates of methane emissions from animals were based on the
              research by Crutzen et al (1986).</p>
