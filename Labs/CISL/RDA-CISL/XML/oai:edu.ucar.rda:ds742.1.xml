              Monthly averages for each 3-hour period during a day,
              and monthly average for all data
              Extended to Jun 30, 1991 as of Jul 5, 1995.

              News as of August 23, 1993:
              ISCCP Global Processing Center is changing the algorithm
              for cloud detecion. The "old" algorithm which was used to
              generate C1 and C2 products so far will be replaced by the
              "new" algorithm. The new algorithm will improve the cloud
              dection in the polar regions.  The production of "C" level
              products of the current and previous months will progress
              in parallel. It is expected to have 10-year
              (July 1983 to June 1994) ISCCP C products in Fall 1995.
              The C1 and C2 products using the "old" algorithm stops
              at the end of June 1991.  Again, if you are interested in
              areas other than the polar regions (cutoff at about 55
              latitude), little change of the cloudiness caused by using
              the new algorithm is expected.
