          Daily Northern Hemisphere Sea Level Pressure Grids, continuing from 1899
          
              The 5-degree latitude/longitude grids contained in this
              dataset make up the longest continuous set of daily gridded
              Northern Hemisphere sea-level pressure data in the DSS archive.
              These grids have been assembled by DSS from the grids of
              
              various meteorological chart digitization projects and
              operational analyses.  Grids begin in 1899 and cover the
              Northern Hemisphere from 15N to the North Pole.  The dataset
              continues to be updated regularly as new data become
              available.
              
              In the earlier years, there is one grid per day, but from
              July 1962 on, there are two grids per day.  Prior to 1946, the
              original grids had a 10-degree resolution and the intermediate
              points were interpolated and indicated as such.  Also in this
              period, there are times when large numbers of gridpoints are
              missing, particularly over the Asian continent.  For more
              information, see the
              
              documentation about original data points.
